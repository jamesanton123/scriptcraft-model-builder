This project was created so that I could insert large objects into other peoples minecraft worlds.

To use this project, you need a vox file (a special format of a 3d model).

One way to import a 3d model into your minecraft world if it is running scriptcraft, is to:

1.) Download a program called poly2vox (http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm)

  a.) Use poly2vox to convert your 3d model into a .kv6 3d model format
  
2.) Download a program called slab6 (http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm)

  a.) Use slab6 to import your .kv6 file and export a .vox file
  
3.) Run this program on the vox file

  a.) Use this program to convert the vox file to javascript file which can be read by scriptcraft drone
